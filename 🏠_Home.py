intro_text = '''
The purpose of this interactive web application is to compliment my thesis, posters and manuscripts, to give the readers a way to run their own calculations. I hope that this would serve as a reasonably fast method of making you (the readers) familiar with DFT based embedding.

Embedding techniques are usually needed to perform calculations on large systems where treating the entire system using a very expensive higher level of theory is not feasible. Therefore, the total system is divided into two or more subsystems, and the subsystem corresponding to the region of interest is treated at a higher level of theory like wavefunction theory (WFT) methods while the remaining subsystems can be treated using a lower level of theory like LDA-DFT.
